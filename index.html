          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Strong evidence linking income and health suggests that policies promoting economic equity may have broad health effects.</p>
          <p>Though it is easy to imagine how health is tied to income for the very poor or the very rich, the relationship between income and health is a gradient: they are connected step-wise at every level of the economic ladder. Middle-class Americans are healthier than those living in or near poverty, but they are less healthy than the upper class. Even wealthy Americans are less healthy than those Americans with higher incomes.</p>
          <p>Obesity can occur at any age, even in young children. But as you age, hormonal changes and a less active lifestyle increase your risk of obesity. In addition, the amount of muscle in your body tends to decrease with age. Generally, lower muscle mass leads to a decrease in metabolism.</p>
          <p>Current cigarette smoking was highest among people aged 34–44 years. The relationship between smoking and poverty isn't causal — that is, poverty alone doesn't cause any individual to take up smoking. Instead there is a complex web of reasons why low-income people are more likely to use cigarettes, including resource inequity, systemic toxic environments, and corporate exploitation, relationships that show not just how poverty affects smoking, but how poverty affects life and reality for the living poor in the richest nation on earth.</p>
